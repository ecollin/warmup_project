## Driving in a Square
### High-level approach
The high level approach for driving of a square was fairly simple. A square is just two sets of parallel lines, joined with right angles. Our robot just needs to move straight for an equal period of time 4 separate times, and turn 90° between each of these periods of straight movement, and the resulting shape will be a square. (You could also turn -90° as long as you are consistent.) 

### Structure of the code
### 

For each robot behavior, describe the problem and your approach at a high-level. Include any relevant diagrams or pictures that help to explain your approach.
Describe the structure of your code. For the functions you wrote, describe what each of them does.
While recording your robot's behavior in a rosbag conducting each type of behavior, also record a gif of the robot visually. Include this gif in your writeup and use it for analysis if needed. For instructions on how to make a gif recording, look at Gazebo simulator.
Describe the challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
If you had more time, how would you improve your robot behaviors?
What are your key takeaways from this project that would help you/others in future robot programming assignments? For each takeaway, provide a few sentences of elaboration.
